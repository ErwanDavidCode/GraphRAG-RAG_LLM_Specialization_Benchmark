# GraphRAG-RAG_LLM_Specialization_Benchmark
This project implements and compares RAG and GraphRAG for updating LLMs with recent events (e.g., 2024 U.S. election). Using the Trump24-25 benchmark with human and automatic evaluations, we show that while web access performs often very well, RAG and GraphRAG are solid options for private or specialized data depending on the structure of the data.
